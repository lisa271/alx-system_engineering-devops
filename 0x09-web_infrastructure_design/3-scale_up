An application server and a web server are two different types of servers that are designed to perform different tasks.
A web server is designed to serve web pages or files requested by clients such as web browsers.
A web server typically uses the HTTP protocol to receive requests from clients and send responses back.
A web server is also responsible for processing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and for providing access to other web-based resources such as images, videos, and documents.

An application server, on the other hand, is designed to provide more complex services than a web server.
An application server is typically used to build and host applications that can be accessed over the network.
It can also provide access to databases, handle transactions, and provide a platform for developers to develop applications.

To build a reliable and secure infrastructure for web and application server hosting, you will need to add the following components:

1. Two web servers: Web servers are responsible for serving web pages or files requested by clients.
By adding two web servers, you can ensure that the web server will be able to handle a large number of requests without any disruption.

2. Two application servers: Application servers are designed to provide more complex services than web servers.
By adding two application servers, you can ensure that the application server will be able to handle a large number of requests without any disruption.

3. A load balancer: A load balancer is used to distribute the incoming requests between the web and application servers.
This ensures that the web and application servers are not overwhelmed by the requests.
The load balancer also provides redundancy in case one of the web or application servers fails.

4. A database server: A database server is used to store data that is used by the web and application servers.
By adding a database server, you can ensure that the data is stored securely and is accessible to both the web and application servers.

By adding the above components, you can ensure that the web and application servers can handle a large number of requests without any disruption.
Moreover, the load balancer provides redundancy in case one of the web or application servers fails.
Additionally, the database server ensures that the data is stored securely and is accessible to both the web and application servers.
